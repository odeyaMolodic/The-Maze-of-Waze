# Ex2

this project represents a directional weighted graph.
It's has a road-system or communication network in mind – and support a large number of vertex (over 100,000).
Allow set of operations applicable on a 
vertex and directional edge(src,dest).
including Graph theory algorithms: save to file, is connected, shortest Path…
and also provides GUI to user to see the graphs.

The implementation based on efficient compact representation – Hash Table.
